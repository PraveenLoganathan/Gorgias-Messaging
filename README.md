## Notes

In the Internal Note screenshot, please note that the message 'This is an internal note' was created manually and 'Hi Praveen, please be advised that your order has been shipped.' was created via API. Though the icons of these messages are different, both work as internal notes. This is because, an email isn't being sent in the 2nd case.
